uu52,7,1441541125,looks great and has a wonderful feel the size was only thing that bothers me before purchasing but after trying it amazingly fits me perfect
uu77,31,1441669570,quality is top notch but for a 16 neck its really snug purchase accordingly
uu79,39,1441526477,i believe that these are the best looking longest wearing pants you will ever find i bought them for my nephew to wear in a very hot and greasy commercial kitchen hoping they would be as good as the dickie medical uniforms i used to wear to work in a hospital they came through with flying colors they wash and dry like a dream with no shrinkage very little fading and no wrinkles   even after 10 or more times through the washer and dryer with my nephew mostly washing them in hot water i would highly recommend these pants to anyone
uu71,45,1441676966,i wear a 32 in the waist which fits me comfortably in almost any brand of jeans but these pants also size 32 in the waist made me feel like i weighed 15 pounds extra i could hardly get them over my thighs i would suggest buying a size or maybe even 2 sizes larger than regular hopefully this helps
uu42,19,1441538782,the 1 star review its for poor sizing i went to a wal mart and tried this model pants on i had to wear a 36 to fit all my pants are 33 from other manufacturers and fit just fine i dont understand why dickies cant get this right
uu75,22,1441683924,they are definitely too small ive been buying a couple pair of these pants every year for the past 4 years without any problems i bought 2 more back in january and they fit smaller than usual my weight has been fairly consistent so i know its not me i compared the new pants to a pair of older ones and theres about a 2 inch difference not buying these from amazon again
uu31,1,1441515203,this is a good alternative for anyone who needs a cheap convention safe long knife for a legolas cosplay it would be safe for children as well however it will need touch up painting as whatever paint they put on it in manufacturing chips off en route to stores or your home so if youre using it for a costume and you care about that be prepared to invest some time in repainting that being said it does have the details the original had to an extent so as long as no legolas expert is out to critique your plastic long knives you should be fine it also has holes in the seams so be prepared to putty those up and paint over them again its not perfect but a 700 long knife that requires some elbow grease is cheaper than the united cutlery replicas
uu33,48,1441509300,i got this for my husband because he had an accident two years ago and injured his elbow and hand and was always hurting them at work without knowing it because he has no feelings in them this has worked to protect his elbow and hand so he can do his work and not get them injured i highly recommend them
uu69,45,1441522607,i love them they are exactly what i expected and deliver one mean forarm shiver while protecting the wearer
uu23,38,1441565014,overall the costume was a huge hit at the parties i attended but i spent a long time modifying it so it wouldnt fall apart on me the costume is very thin and uses velcro to hold each piece together normal moving around caused the velcro to come unfastened so i went to the hardware store and bought snaps like the ones used to button a pair of pants not only did these hold the costume together well but they were shinny and looked great
uu44,35,1441559030,at first when i received this the packaging was a bit over whelming there were what seemed like 50 pieces the pieces are plastic but the paint and coating on it makes this costume great i actually bought this to propose to my girlfriend and it worked like a charm i did follow some instructions to use rivets which did help i bought them at osh and hammered them in the rivets should cost about 5 each set of 6 something like that anyways i must say the pictures that were taken make that armor look awesome i plan on using this again on halloween i also bought the 8 sword on amazon to go with it youll see it in the picture ill post in summation its the best quality from cheap plastic materials
uu90,22,1441647369,junk buyer beware this is paper thin junk i cant believe how poor the quality is it is a bunch of flimsy pieces that velcro together with small velcro dots half of the velcro dots are missing or laying loose in the box because they are not sticky enough to stay on we are going to have to figur out how to add velcro or snaps to try tonget it to stay together i would not recommend this product

uu17,2,1441689338,shipment is quick package is great armor quality is ok but the shoulder parts are different from the pictureyou see the gap between the actual shoulder armor and the extended arm protection?the whole shoulder armor is just thick one piece with no flexibility at allif you try to raise your arms over your shoulders you will have a big problem i recommend it for displaying and random cosplay but not if you want a real armor
uu55,2,1441507484,i got myself these gauntlets once i saw how inexpensive they were expecting them to be cheat tin sheet metal boy was i surprised not only are they heavy steel but the craftsmanship is remarkable theyre not too terribly uncomfortable and make a lot of noise while you wear them but thats half the fun theyre all leather and steel with copper rivets to accentuate their design and hold everything together theyre perfect for the guy in your life who likes armor renaissance fairs or just looking ridiculous
uu65,49,1441624524,take these bad boys to any halloween party and prepare to have people regale at your handyness just make sure to not reveal your secret that you paid 50 for them on amazon made out of the finest scrap metal this is probably the best way to overpay 50 for two over sized cans of baked beans theyre lined with the most opulent leather hide for minimal comfort when adorned
uu85,11,1441526659,i ordered these gloves for my son because he loves medieval festivals and fairs so he wanted to go as a knight i saw these i thought they were at an amazing price and baught them when they came in both of the gloves were right handed we had to compromise with leather gloves for the festival not only that but the thumb piece kept overlapping over the other fingers if anyone else has this problem let me know
uu48,6,1441560804,i knew exactly what i was getting in too when i bought this i wasnt planing on this lasting me a long time in my full combat sport i play dagorhir but to last me until i collected enough cash to get an expensive chain mail its holding up just as plan i lost quite a bit in the arm pit region but that is to be expected the price is the cheapest i have found and worth the buy if you are not in too full combat larping or something just to get you by until you can afford a better quality set
uu94,45,1441663710,when i got it i was surprised it felt and looked pretty real that is until i put it on for a day i couldnt imagine it lasting more than a month without falling apart links are constantly breaking off under light use sleeves are way too long im 6ft tall and it goes down past my knees which hinders movement its also tight around the waist as if made for a rather small character
uu56,1,1441513353,ever since i was a kid i wanted to be a knight so around halloween id been working quite a bit and accumulating massive amount of overtime so for the holiday thats exactly what i did this isnt some master worked chainmail but its nice all the same im impressed it actually fit me at all im 66 with a 56 chest and this fit me just fine the chainmail came down a few inches past my groin and the sleeves came to about my mid forearm granted if youre smaller than i am itll probably fit you like it looks in the pictures and for 120 buck come on this is a major deal ive seen chainmail in poor quality go for way more than this chainmail which is decent quality i wouldnt wade into battle with this stuff but man was i the prime specimen at the parties chicks dig chainmail
